## Overview
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing task that involves classifying text data into different sentiment categories. In this project, we explore different machine learning models and techniques to perform sentiment analysis on textual data.

## Methodology

The sentiment analysis task is performed using the following steps:

### Data Preprocessing: 

Text data is cleaned and preprocessed to remove noise and irrelevant information. This includes tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and removing stop words.

### Feature Extraction:
Text features are extracted from the preprocessed data using techniques such as Bag-of-Words (BoW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Word Embeddings (Word2Vec), and Document Embeddings (Doc2Vec).

### Model Training:
Various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost are trained on the extracted features.

### Model Evaluation: 

The trained models are evaluated using F1-score to measure their performance on the sentiment analysis task.
